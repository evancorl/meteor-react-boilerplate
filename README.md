# Meteor React Boilerplate
A (slightly opinionated) boilerplate for Meteor React apps.

To get started:
```
git clone git@github.com:evancorl/meteor-react-boilerplate.git
cd meteor-react-boilerplate
npm install
npm run start
```

Don't forget to reconfigure the project as your own Git repo:
```
rm -rf .git
git init
```

And make sure you add `settings.json` to your `.gitignore` list if it contains private app information.

More to come later!
